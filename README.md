# odin-recipes
In this repo I will be making a simple website showing differnet recipies by using the HTML knowledge I have gathered so far.
I will also try to do git operations in as proffesional way as possible and structure it in a way that after completing this website when i look at the logs i can understand all the working process it was gone through.
